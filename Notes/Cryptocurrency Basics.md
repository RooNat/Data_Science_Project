## What is Cryptocurrency

> [What is cryptocurrecny and how does it work?](https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/resource-center/definitions/what-is-cryptocurrency)

Cryptocurrency, sometimes called crypto-currency or crypto, is any form of currency that exists digitally or virtually and uses **cryptography** to secure transactions. Cryptocurrencies <u>don't have a central issuing or regulating authority</u>, instead using **<u>a decentralized system</u>** to record transactions and issue new units.[^1]

It's a peer-to-peer system that can enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments. Instead of being physical money carried around and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific transactions.[^1]

### How does cryptocurrency work?

Cryptocurrencies run on a distributed public ledger called blockchain, a record of all transactions updated and held by currency holders.[^1]

Units of cryptocurrency are created through a process called <u>**mining**</u>, which involves using computer power to solve complicated mathematical problems that generate coins. Users can also buy the currencies from brokers, then store and spend them using cryptographic wallets.[^1]

### Cryptocurrency examples

There are thousands of cryptocurrencies. Some of the best known include:[^1]

| Cryptocurrency | Introduction                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Bitcoin        | Founded in 2009, Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and is still the most commonly traded. The currency was developed by Satoshi Nakamoto – widely believed to be a pseudonym for an individual or group of people whose precise identity remains unknown. |
| Ethereum       | Developed in 2015, Ethereum is a **blockchain platform** with its own cryptocurrency, called Ether (ETH) or Ethereum. It is the most popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. |
| Litecoin       | This currency is most similar to bitcoin but has moved more quickly to develop new innovations, including faster payments and processes to allow more transactions. |
| Ripple         | Ripple is a distributed ledger system that was founded in 2012. Ripple can be used to track different kinds of transactions, not just cryptocurrency. The company behind it has worked with various banks and financial institutions. |

Non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies are collectively known as “altcoins” to distinguish them from the original.

### What is crypto trading?

The act of speculating on cryptocurrency price movements via a contract for difference(CFD) trading account, or buying and selling the underlying coins via an exchange is known as cryptocurrency or crypto trading. [CFD trading](#What is CFD trading and how does it work?) is a type of derivative that allows you to bet on **Bitcoin**(BTC) price changes without possessing the underlying currencies.[^2]

For example, you can **go long (buy)** if you believe the value of a cryptocurrency will rise, or **short (sell)** if you believe the value will fall. Both are <u>**leveraged instruments**</u>, which means that you only need a little deposit, known as margin trading crypto, to have total exposure to the underlying market. However, because your profit or loss is still determined based on the total size of your investment, leveraging trading crypto magnifies both earnings and losses. 

### How to trade cryptocurrency for beginners

1. Sign up for a cryptocurrency exchange
2. Fund your account
3. Pick a crypto to invest in
4. Start trading
5. Store your cryptocurrency



### Structure of a crypto trade

A cryptocurrency trade consists of a **buyer** and a **seller**. Since there are two opposing sides to a trade — a purchase and a sale — someone is bound to gain more than the other.

Hence, **trading is inherently a zero-sum game**: There is a winner and there is a loser.

When a price is agreed upon between a buyer and seller, the trade is executed (via an exchange) and the market valuation for the asset is set. For the most part, buyers tend to set [orders at a lower price](https://cointelegraph.com/trading-for-beginners/crypto-trading-basics-a-beginners-guide-to-cryptocurrency-order-types) than sellers. This creates the two sides of an order book.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooNat/Myimages/main/2023/06/upgit_20230607_1686140737.png" alt="image-20230607132535485" style="zoom:50%;" />

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooNat/Myimages/main/2023/06/upgit_20230607_1686151966.JPG" alt="IMG_3126" style="zoom:50%;" />

> When there are more buy orders for crypto than sell orders, the price usually goes up, as there’s more demand for the asset. Conversely, when more people are selling than buying, the price goes down. In many exchange interfaces, buys and sales are represented in different colors. This is to give the trader a quick indication of the state of the market at a given moment.

1. To **go long on an asset (longing)** means **buying an asset** and earning profit based on its upward price movement.
2. In contrast, **going short on an asset (shorting)** essentially means **selling an asset** with the intention of buying it back when its price falls below the point at which you sold it, profiting from a price drop. 



**Styles of trading:** 

| Day trading                                                  | Swing trading                                                | Position trading                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Also known as "intraday trading", day trading invovles traders entering and exiting positions within the same day | Swing traders follow short-term to intermediate-term trands that can range anywhere between 1 and 30 days | Also known as "trend trading", position trading entails buying and holding an asset for longer periods of time. |

#### Order types

**There is a risk when you're trading:** Because you're opening your position on **margin**, you can incur losses rapidly if the market moves against you.

**==Five order types: Stop and Limit and Market==**

When you place an order on the chart, it's an instruction to your broker. All these orders can be used for **<u>target positioning, getting into a trade, stop loss</u>**

| Type             | Interpretation and situation                                 | Situation                                                    | Schematic                                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Buy **limit**    | A crypto limit order is an instruction to buy a cryptocurrency only at a price specified by the trader. It is best suited for the trader who can patiently wait for a price target to be reached. | Set a buy level when assuming there is a upcoming [pull back](#Reading the Phases) to go up | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooNat/Myimages/main/2023/06/upgit_20230608_1686221370.png" alt="image-20230608114929194"  /> |
| Sell **limit**   | A crypto limit order is an instruction to sell a cryptocurrency only at a price specified by the trader. It is best suited for the trader who can patiently wait for a price target to be reached. | Set a sell level when assuming there is a upcoming [pull back](#Reading the Phases) to go down | ![image-20230608114956242](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooNat/Myimages/main/2023/06/upgit_20230608_1686221397.png) |
| Buy **stop**     | A stop order is set to buy a cryptocurrency at the market price once it has hit the stop price. In that case, the order becomes a market order and is filled at the next available market price. | Set a buy level when assuming that keep going up             | ![image-20230608115015755](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooNat/Myimages/main/2023/06/upgit_20230608_1686221416.png) |
| Sell **stop**    | A stop order is set to sell a cryptocurrency at the market price once it has hit the stop price. In that case, the order becomes a market order and is filled at the next available market price. | Set a sell level when assuming that keep going down          | ![image-20230608115033036](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooNat/Myimages/main/2023/06/upgit_20230608_1686221434.png) |
| **Market** order | A market order is an instruction by a trader to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at the best available price in the crypto market and provide instant execution. It is considered the simplest and most basic type of crypto order. | this order is just you watching the charts live and clicking buy or sell and giving your broker an instant instruction as soon as possible to buy or sell that market |                                                              |

- <u>**Stop-loss**</u>: 
  - **There is a risk when you're trading:** Because you're opening your position on **margin**, you can incur losses rapidly if the market moves against you. To help manage this risk, you can set a stop-loss level in the deal ticket. If triggered, the stop-loss will automatically close your position and cap your risk.
  - Can be Buy-Limit, Sell-Limit, At-Market, Buy-Stop, Sell-stop.
    - Don't use at Market orders for stop losses.
- **Entry**: Can be Buy-Limit, Sell-Limit, At-Market, Buy-Stop, Sell-stop.
- **Target: **Can be Buy-Limit, Sell-Limit, At-Market, Buy-Stop, Sell-stop.
- **<u>Limit level:</u>**
  - To lock in any profits if the market moves in your favour, you can also enter a limit level. Here, your trade will be automatically closed to secure positive returns as soon as the market reaches the price you’ve set.

Remember that, when trading CFDs, each contract will specify an amount per point of market movement. If the CFD is for \$10 per point, and the underlying cryptocurrency price moves 10 points, your profit or loss – excluding costs – will be \$100 per contract.

Once you’ve set the number of CFDs you want to trade, your stop-loss and limit levels, you’d open your position by clicking on **‘place trade’**.

### Reading the markets

Overall, there are two market trends: **bullish** and **bearish**.

Bullish and bearish trends can also exist within other larger opposing trends, depending on the time horizon at which you look. For example, a small bearish trend may occur within a broader long-term bullish trend. In general, an uptrend results in price action making higher highs and higher lows. A downtrend makes lower highs and lower lows.

#### Bullish market

A “bullish” market, or bull market, occurs when the price action appears to steadily increase. These upward price movements are also known as “pumps,” as the influx of buyers increases the prices. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooNat/Myimages/main/2023/06/upgit_20230608_1686217577.png" alt="image-20230608104610093" style="zoom:50%;" />

#### Bearish market

A “bearish” market, or bear market, occurs when the price action appears to steadily decrease. These downward price movements are also known as “dumps,” as the mass sell-offs result in the price going lower.

![image-20230608104631635](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooNat/Myimages/main/2023/06/upgit_20230608_1686217592.png)



#### Consolidation(Ranging Market)

Another market state called “consolidation” occurs when the price trades sideways or within a range. Typically, consolidation phases are easier to spot on higher time frames (daily charts or weekly charts) and they occur when an asset is cooling off after a sharp upward or downward trend. Consolidation also takes place ahead of trend reversals, or in times when demand is muted and trading volumes are low. Prices essentially trade within a range during this market state.

![image-20230608104713777](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooNat/Myimages/main/2023/06/upgit_20230608_1686217635.png)



#### Indecisive Market

Recommended to stay away during this

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooNat/Myimages/main/2023/06/upgit_20230608_1686217681.png" alt="image-20230608104759849" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Reading the Phases

Identify the market phase:

1. **Run**: Extension in the direction of the trend

2. **Pullback**: Retracement; the outside return; **Momentary correction** before we continue to the upside

   ![image-20230608105310756](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooNat/Myimages/main/2023/06/upgit_20230608_1686217993.png)

---

**==First Step==**: Identify the market condition - Bullish or Bearish

**==Second Step==**: Identify the Phases

- If on **<u>a bullish chart</u>** and we had a bias that the market is **<u>going up</u>**(assumption), we don't buy **<u>in the middle of the up and down runs</u>**.
- What should be done is **<u>identify the pullback</u>** and then look to **buy** the market so we get the best possible price.(Based on the rules: Sell high, buy low)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooNat/Myimages/main/2023/06/upgit_20230608_1686218795.png" alt="image-20230608110633625" style="zoom:50%;" />



**==Third Step==**: We want to see when the market is likely to change the direction, there are some clues:

- By [Angular Trend Lines](#Trendlines)
- By identitying the [resistance and support](#Support and resistance)
- See the last [**candlesticks **patterns](#Chart patterns - Candlestick) (Price action)
- **Fibonacci retracement**
  - You have to drag it from the most recent pullback to the most recent low. One of the most popular ratios people look for is a 382 retracemetn for a trend. 382 is an indication for a strong trend.

Even Handle numbers is also an indication. Look for candlestick formation to make sure you can place an order. Also look at what happened in the past. Compare patterns from the past to a current pattern to make predictions.

### Technical analysis

**Technical analysis (TA)** is a method of analyzing past market data, primarily **price** and **volume** in order to forecast price action. 

#### Market strucutre and cycles

![image-20230607143406153](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooNat/Myimages/main/2023/06/upgit_20230607_1686144847.png)

Just as traders can spot patterns within hours, days and months, they can also find patterns over years of fluctuating price action. There is a fundamental structure to the market that makes it susceptible to certain behaviors.

<u>The cycle can be partitioned into four main parts</u>: **accumulation**, **markup**, **distribution** and **decline**. As the market moves between these phases, traders will continuously adapt their positions by consolidating, retracing, or correcting as they deem necessary.

#### Chasing the whale

Price movements are largely driven by “**whales**” — <u>individuals or groups who have large funds with which to trade</u>. Some whales operate as “market makers,” setting bids and asking on both sides of the market in order to create liquidity for an asset while turning a profit in the process. Whales are present in virtually any market from stocks and commodities to cryptocurrencies. 

#### Psychological cycles

With a zoo full of metaphors, it can be easy to forget that real people — for the most part — are behind these trades and, as such, are subject to **emotional behaviors** that can significantly affect the market.



### Basic Tools

The micro perspective is also crucial in determining your actual strategy. While there are a vast number of TA indicators, we will only go over the most basic.

#### Support and resistance

Perhaps two of the most widely used TA indicators under the terms “support” and “resistance” relate to price barriers that tend to form in the market, preventing the price action from going too far in a certain direction.

| Support                                                      | Resistance                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The support is the price level where the downward trend trends to pause due to an influx of demand. When prices decrease, traders tend to buy low, creating a support line. | Conversely, the resistance is the price level where the upward trend tends to pause due to a sell-off |

![image-20230607152437664](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooNat/Myimages/main/2023/06/upgit_20230607_1686147878.png)

Many cryptocurrency traders use support and resistance levels to bet on the direction of the price, adapting on the fly as the price level breaks through either its upper or lower bounds.

#### Trendlines

While the static support and resistance barriers shown above are common tools used by traders, the price action tends to trend higher or lower with barriers shifting over time.

A sequence of support and resistance levels can indicate a larger trend in the market represented by a trendline.

When the market is trending upward, resistance levels begin to form, price action slows and the price is pulled back to the trendline. Cryptocurrency traders pay close attention to the support levels of an ascending trendline, as they indicate an area that helps prevent the price from dropping substantially lower. Likewise, in a downward trending market, traders will keep an eye on the sequence of declining peaks to connect them together into a trendline.

Sometimes, what you can see is that each of the pullbacks, if you draw a line from the close of the candle all the way to the most recent one, you'll find that there is something called **angular support**.

![image-20230608111812585](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooNat/Myimages/main/2023/06/upgit_20230608_1686219493.png)

![image-20230607152843669](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooNat/Myimages/main/2023/06/upgit_20230607_1686148125.png)

**<u>The core element is the history of the market.</u>** The strength of any support or resistance levels and their resulting trendlines increases as they reoccur over time. Hence, traders will record these barriers to inform their ongoing trading strategy.

#### Round numbers

One influence on support/resistance levels is the fixation on **round-number** price levels by inexperienced or institutional investors. When a large number of trades center around a nice round number — such as generally occurs with Bitcoin each time its price approaches a figure that is evenly divisible by $10,000, for example — it can be difficult for the price to surpass this point, creating a resistance.

#### Moving averages

With a market history of support/resistance levels and the resulting downward/upward trendlines, traders often smooth out this data to create a single visual line representation called the “moving average.”

![image-20230607153150520](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooNat/Myimages/main/2023/06/upgit_20230607_1686148311.png)

The moving average nicely traces the bottom support levels of an upward trend along with the peaks of resistance throughout a downward trend. When analyzed with respect to trading volume, the moving average provides a useful indicator of short-term momentum.

#### Chart patterns - Candlestick

There are various ways to chart the market and find patterns within it. One of the most common visual representations of market price action is the “**<u>candlestick</u>**.” These candlestick patterns present a sort of visual language for traders to anticipate possible trends.[^2]

| Basic Candlestick | Schematic                                                    | Interpretation                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Green Candles     | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooNat/Myimages/main/2023/06/upgit_20230608_1686215777.png" alt="image-20230608101616080" style="zoom:50%;" /> | Closed price at the end of the hour higher than opened price |
| Red Candles       | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooNat/Myimages/main/2023/06/upgit_20230608_1686215796.png" alt="image-20230608101635445" style="zoom:50%;" /> | Closed a lower price than opened                             |
| OHLC Bars         | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooNat/Myimages/main/2023/06/upgit_20230608_1686216059.png" alt="image-20230608102058694" style="zoom:50%;" /> | Open, High, Low, Close; is read same as the candles          |

---

**Two main components of candlestick** that really give you an edge as a trader:

1. **Close**: Where the close happens
2. **Candle Wick**: which is either the wick to the upside or the wick to the downside.

### Fundamental analysis

How does one determine if an asset is based on sound fundamentals rather than hype, exaggerated technology, or worse — nothing at all? For fundamental analysis of new assets, several factors should be considered: [^2]

1. Developers

2. Community
3. Technical sepcifications
4. Innovation
5. Liquidity(and whales)
6. Branding and marketing

### Crypto trading vs Stock trading

**Common**:

Stocks and cryptocurrency are two very distinct types of investment vehicles. While both are liquid assets that belong in your speculative portfolio, that's where the similarities end. These are two entirely different kinds of securities that should be kept in separate portions of your portfolio.

**Difference:**

1. Stocks are the ownership stakes of a publicly traded corporation. Each share of stock you purchase gives you a percentage stake in the company. This ownership is proportional to the number of shares issued by a corporation.

   An investor can profit by selling their stock to other investors. The difference between what you spend for the asset and what you get when you sell it is known as capital gains. Aside from that, the advantages of owning shares are entirely dependent on the firm in question. Stocks can also gain value by providing dividends to their shareholders and exercising voting power.

2. A cryptocurrency is a digital asset that exists solely on the internet. This means it doesn't have a physical component and only exists as records in an online ledger that tracks ownership. This is in contrast to the United States dollar, which has both a physical (you can withdraw and hold a dollar bill) and a digital component (you can own a dollar as nothing more than an entry in your bank account recording that ownership). A cryptocurrency’s individual unit is referred to as a token, much as a stock's individual unit is referred to as a share.



## Risk Position

I'll allocating 1% of my account to split across the amount of risk.

![image-20230608121542426](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooNat/Myimages/main/2023/06/upgit_20230608_1686222943.png)

## Identify trades

In this bearish trend, what I'm looking for is a continuation setup, I'm looking for market to go to the pullback phase, and then I'm looking to sell and come out a profit, and I can buy back at a profit.

In the last pullback, what I'm looking for is the last candle where the closed price is lower than the previous candle's closed price.

## Positive Expectancy

There is a formula:
$$
\text{Positive Expectancy}=[1-(\dfrac{W}{L})]\times P -1
$$
Where 

-  $P$ is the strike rate, means how often you're right
- $W$ is the average win, the unit of it is dollar
- $L$ is the average loss.



**==Example:==**

In one case, $W$ is \$200, $L$ is \$170, $P$ is 0.55, so we get:
$$
\text{Positive Expectancy}=[1+(200/170)]\times 0.55 -1=0.2
$$
which is greater than 0, indicating that it is possible to profitable.

If PE is further above 0, it would be better.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooNat/Myimages/main/2023/06/upgit_20230608_1686238683.png" alt="image-20230608163802445" style="zoom:50%;" />

| Need to be filled in the form | Interpretation                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Amount**                    | The price we set for per pip/point.                          |
| **Order level**               | The price level we want to entry, when the market hit this level, we will buy or sell |
| **Stop**                      | Set the stop loss. When the market price hit this level, we will close our position to reduce the loss. |
| **Limit**                     | Set the target, when the market price hit this level, we will buy or sell to get the profit. |

#### Example - Pipeline

Now I'm going to buy 'UK100-Rolling Cash', I need to decide the how many the amount is, the order level, the stop and the limit.

1. Frist, I determine the amount of the money I'd like to risk. Here I set \$100. That means this is the maximum amount I could lose.

2. See the market trend to determine the stop and limit level.

   > Using the indicators, like the support and resistance, pullback and run

3. Use the amount of risk money(100) to be divided by the Points away($\text{Order level} - \text{Stop level}$), which are 17 points, we can finally get the amount(5.88, as the screenshot shows below), It shows that if we lose, we are going to lose almost 100 dollars, but if we win, we are going to get almost 300 dollars.

   In this case: $100/17 \approx 5.88$

4. After submit the order, we can see the order in the dashboard:

## What is CFD trading and how does it work?

> [What is CFD trading and how does it work?](https://www.ig.com/en/cfd-trading/what-is-cfd-trading-how-does-it-work)

CFD trading is the method of speculating on the underlying price of an asset – like shares, indices, commodities, cryptos, forex and more – on a trading platform like ours. A CFD – short for ‘contract for difference’ – is the type of derivative that enables you to trade the price movements of these financial markets with us.

With this form of trading, you don’t own the underlying asset – you’re only getting exposure to its price movements.

### 3 FD trading essentials

1. You can go long or short with CFDs
2. CFD trading is leveraged
3. You'll open a leveraged position with margin
